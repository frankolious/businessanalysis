5. Business Requirement Document
A Business Requirement Document is created to describe the business requirements of a product/process and the intended end result that is expected from the product/process. It is one of the most widely accepted project requirement documents and is referred to throughout the development life cycle for any project.

A BRD mainly focuses on answering ‘what is the business solution’ as opposed to ‘how to achieve the business solution’, and thus, it’s mainly centered around the business requirements.

A BRD is created with the help of the project team (BA, client, subject matter experts, business partners) and is also used as a communication tool for other stakeholders/external service providers.

The Business Requirement Document contains:
– Project Background
– Business goals and objectives
– Stakeholders
– Requirement scope
– Functional requirements
– Data requirements
– Non-functional requirements
– Interface requirements
– Business glossary/Definitions
– Dependencies of existing systems
– Assumptions
