3. Use cases
Each project is an endeavor to achieve ‘requirements,’ and the document that defines these requirements is a use case. A use case is a methodology used in system analysis to identify, define, and organize system requirements.

A use case is created from the perspective of a user and achieves the following objectives:
1. Organizes the functional requirements,
2. Iterative in nature and updated throughout the project life-cycle
3. Records scenarios in which a user will interact with the system
4. Defines other aspects like negative flows, UI elements, exceptions, etc..

The Use Case document contains:
– Actors
– Description
– Trigger
– Preconditions
– Normal Flow
– Alternative Flows
– Exceptions
– Special Requirements
– Assumptions
– Notes and Issues
