- Wireframes - These are visual representations of expected UI needed as a product feature. It is made from an end-user aspect and forms the basis of UI/UX designs. They are also called the blueprint of the website which is being built. They make it very easy for the business analyst to explain the feature to the development tool. The most common tool for wireframes is Balsamiq. 

- MockUp - Imagine a scenario where there needs to be a very small change, maybe a new button or removal of any tab. The use case in this would be simple and not very bulky. Business Analysts can just capture the screenshot and manipulate the existing UI to showcase what the new UI should look like. This process of making a new product feature out of the existing one is known as Mock-Ups. I prefer to use a very simple tool for this which is MS-Paint. 

- Prototyping - This is also similar to mock-ups, but it has a defined template to follow. The reason to do prototyping is the identification, description, and validation of the needs of the customer from the user interface aspect. This can be made by various tools as it is the step in which the business analyst expresses the feature in a visual format.
Data Flow Diagram - Any feature would be part of some flow of the product or would derive a new flow itself. Before the initiation of any project, the analyst definitely draws the flow diagram. There are various tools to draw them - MS Visio, Lucidchart, draw.io, etc. 

- Data Dictionary - A business analyst also works towards framing a data dictionary for the product. This helps him/her to finalize any requirement easily as it gives the insights of the database of the product and thus it is convenient to explain to developers. It can be prepared in MS Excel or with agile in the market, people are making use of Confluence to design this.
