9. Test case
Although Business analysts are not explicitly asked to create test cases, they must understand what they constitute and how to create one, as they sometimes have to test functionalities by referring to the test cases.

A test case is a document, which has a set of test data, preconditions, variables, and expected results created to verify and validate whether a particular piece of functionality is behaving as intended (or as documented in the requirement documentation). Thus, a test case becomes a standardized document that should be referred to every time a requirement has to undergo testing.

The components of a test case are:
– Test Case ID
– Test Scenario
– Prerequisite
– Test Data
– Test Steps
– Expected Results
– Actual Result
– Status
– Remarks
– Test Environment

All the above documents are created by a business analyst and are part of the project/product documentation. These documents are constantly referred through the project’s life cycle for communication, reference, and revision.
