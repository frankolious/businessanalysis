1. # Project Vision Document
Although mainly the client/project manager creates a project vision document, business analysts are also expected to contribute to this document. A Project vision document entails the purpose and intent of the product/software to be developed and describes ‘what’ business objective will be achieved on a high level.

The Project vision document contains:
- Introduction
- Description of users in the system
- Project stakeholders
- Product Overview
- Product Features
- Product requirements
- Constraints/Limitations
- Quality/documentation requirements
