7. # Functional requirement specification (FRS)/ Functional Specification Document (FSD)
A Functional requirement specification or Functional Specification Document describes the intended behavior of a system, including data, operations, input, output, and the properties of the system.

In a BRD, the requirements are high level, but in an FRS/FSD, they are written in many more details to capture each and every aspect of a requirement. Thus a functional specification document becomes a more technical, accurate, and descriptive requirement document.

Owing to their technical nature, FRS/FSD are equally used by developers, testers, and the business stakeholders of a project.

The Functional requirement specification (FRS)/Functional Specification Document (FSD) contains:
- Product Context
- Assumptions
- Constraints
- Dependencies
- Functional Requirements
- User Interface Requirements
- Usability
- Performance
- Manageability/Maintainability
- System Interface/Integration
- Security
- Requirements Confirmation/sign-off
